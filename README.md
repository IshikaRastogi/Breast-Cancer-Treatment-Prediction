# Breast-Cancer-Treatment-Prediction
Breast Cancer Treatment Prediction using ANN model
 Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers affecting women worldwide. It is the leading cause
 of cancer-related deaths among women, accounting for over 600,000 deaths annually. Early detection
 and treatment of breast cancer are crucial for improving survival rates and reducing the morbidity
 associated with the disease. One way to improve the early detection and treatment of breast cancer is
 through the use of artificial neural networks (ANNs).
 ANNs are a type of machine learning algorithm inspired by the structure and function of the human
 brain. They are capable of learning complex patterns and relationships in data and can be used for a
 wide range of applications, including medical diagnosis and prognosis. In the context of breast cancer
 treatment prediction, ANNs can be trained on patient data to predict the likelihood of recurrence or
 metastasis, helping clinicians to make more informed treatment decisions.
 The aim of this project is to develop an ANN-based model for breast cancer treatment prediction.
 The model will be trained on a dataset of patient records, including clinical, pathological, and genetic
 data. The input data will be preprocessed and normalized before being fed into the neural network.
 The output of the model will be either a therapy or a combination of therapies recommended for the
 particular patient. The performance of the model will be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy,
 precision, recall, F1-measure and ROC curve. Ultimately, the goal of this project is to develop a
 reliable and accurate tool for clinicians to aid in the early detection and treatment of breast cancer.
